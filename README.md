A basic Flutter Application used to learn States in Flutter

## What it is about

The app is used to add and remove tasks with a sliding animation. It also has a light mode to dark mode switch.
On pressing the To-Do text on the screen it changes from light mode to dark mode and vice versa.
It also has a task counter which counts the number of tasks dynamically using Statful Widgets.
